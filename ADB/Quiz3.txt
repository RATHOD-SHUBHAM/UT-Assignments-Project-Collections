 4a. Using the cloud services provider, all functionality possible should be implemented on that provider.
     (Of course, displaying web pages through a browser and the user interface is "local")

 4b. Upload all data files (*csv, not this quiz) to cloud service. 
  
Show and submit code, when each part is complete, raise your hand and then show us:

 To recieve credit you MUST show (demo) AND submit the code (text only) on Canvas.

  5. Show a web page and interface (which resides on the cloud provider) with your name,

    appropriately.

	Answer : I went to azure data studio. There i connected to my azure account. and then i added my csv file giving my credentials on datastudio.




  6. Allow a user, through a web form, to give a mag range (for example 2 to 3.1), and show us the matching result tuples
     for that request. (Show lat, long, place, mag, id)
     Show us the time taken to perform that operation.

Answer : @app.route('/six', methods=['GET','POST'])
def six():
    magOne = float(request.form['one'])
    print("magOne is : ",magOne)
    magtwo = float(request.form['two'])
    print("magOne is : ",magtwo)

    start_time = time.time()

    sql = " SELECT latitude,longitude,place,mag,id from quake where mag between " + str(magOne) + " and " + str(magtwo) + "; "
    cursor.execute(sql)
    myResult = cursor.fetchall()
    end_time = time.time()
    time_diff = end_time - start_time

    return render_template("six.html", time=time_diff, output = myResult)


<form action="/six" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <h2> Quiz Question six : </h2>
    <br>
    
    <label for="one">mag range one :</label><br>
    <input type="number" id="one" name="one" value= 2><br><br>
    <label for="two">mag range two :</label><br>
    <input type="number" id="two" name="two" value= 3.2><br>

    <button type = "submit" value="Submit"> Submit </button><br><br>

<h1><p>{{time}}</p></h1>
<h1><label>latitude , longitude, place, mag, id</label></h1>
{% for i in output %}
<h1><p>{{i}}</p></h1>
{% endfor %}




  7. Allow a user to give a mag range (for example 2 to 4), and a value D, and you will generate 
     a random select within that mag range plus or minus D (that is if you generate a mag value of 3.2, and D equals 0.1,
     select all quakes with mag between 3.2-0.1 up to 3.2+0.1), show us the result, as in the previous question.
     Show us the time taken to perform that operation.

Answer : 
@app.route('/seven', methods=['GET','POST'])
def seven():
    magOne = float(request.form['one'])
    print("magOne is : ",magOne)
    magtwo = float(request.form['two'])
    print("magtwo is : ",magtwo)
    Dval = float(request.form['D'])
    print("D valaue is : ",Dval)


    start_time = time.time()

    mag = random.uniform(magOne, magtwo)
    print(" the mag is : ", mag)

    randOne = mag - Dval
    print("randOne is : ",randOne)
    randOne = round(randOne,1)
    print("The rand one is : ",randOne)
    randTwo = mag + Dval
    print("randtwo is : ",randTwo)
    randTwo = round(randTwo,1)
    print("the rand two value is : ",randTwo)

    sql = " SELECT latitude,longitude,place,mag,id from quake where mag between " + str(randOne) + " and " + str(randTwo) + "; "
    cursor.execute(sql)
    myResult = cursor.fetchall()
    end_time = time.time()
    time_diff = end_time - start_time

    return render_template("seven.html", time=time_diff, output = myResult)

  8. Modify part 7, to allow a value N (up to 1000), and repeat the selections N times.
     Show time taken for each, and for all operations.



@app.route('/eight', methods=['GET','POST'])
def eight():
    magOne = float(request.form['one'])
    print("magOne is : ",magOne)

    for i in range(0,Ntime):

  9. Repeat 8. using an in-memory caching mechanism (NOT an in-memory database) repeat the previous step, then show us.
